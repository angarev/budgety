# Budget app

The project is a part of Jonas Schmedtmann's course - The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects! This course is different because it's not just about writing code, it's also about how and why code works the way it does. Because it's the perfect mix between theory and practice. Because it focuses not only on small coding examples, but also on real-world projects and use cases.
